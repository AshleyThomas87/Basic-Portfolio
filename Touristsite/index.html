                    It’s simply one of Arizona’s best-kept secrets.

                    <li>The Public Finally Learned of the Kartchner Caverns in 1988 discovered in 1984 by Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts. The formation in the Caverns
                    are called Speleothems. They form when water passes from the surface into the cave. The minerals in the cave mixed with the water over time
                    form these amazing and archetypal giant cave structures.

                    <li>Petrified Forest National Park is the only national park site that contains a segment of the Historic Route 66 alignment. 
                        Part of the National Old Trails Highway also passed through the park. The brilliant colors in the petrified wood come mainly from three
                        minerals. Pure quartz is white, manganese oxides form blue, purple, black, and brown, and iron oxides provide hues from yellow through red to brown.

            <p id="info">At its peak, Tombstone is said to have been the fastest growing city
                between St. Louis and San Francisco. There were over one hundred saloons, numerous restaurants, a large red-light district, schools, churches, newspapers, 
                and one of the first public swimming pools in Arizona (which is still used today). The most famous event in Tombstone’s history was the famed Gunfight
                at the OK Corral, which didn’t actually happen at the corral,but in a
                vacant lot on Fremont Street. On October 26, 1881 members of the
                “Cowboys” had a run-in with Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp with help
                from Wyatt’s friend Doc Holliday. 24 seconds and 30 shots later, Billy
                Clanton, Tom and Frank McLaury were mortally wounded. In many
                people’s opinion, it was this one event that has kept Tombstone alive for all
                these years.

                    <p id="content">The cactus wren is the official state bird. It grows seven to eight inches long and likes to build nests in the protection of thorny
                        desert plants like the arms of the giant saguaro cactus.
                        The Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake is perhaps the most beautiful of all eleven species of rattlesnakes found in Arizona.
                        The ringtail is the official state mammal. The ringtail is a small fox-like animal about two and one-half feet long and is a shy,
                        nocturnal creature.
                        The Arizona tree frog is the state official amphibian. The frog is actually between three-quarter to two inches long.
