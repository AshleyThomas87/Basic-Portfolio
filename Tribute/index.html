            <p>     Construction was completed in January 1964. The facility consisted of a one-mile oval and a 2.5-mile road course.
                Alan Kulwicki won the first Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Phoenix on Nov. 6, 1988.The first spring race 
                was held on April 23, 2005 and was also the first night race, which was won by Kurt Busch. The track underwent its 
                first repave in 2011. The construction began in March and concluded in September of that year. The following changes 
                were made during the construction period (March â€“ Sept. 2011): Widened the frontstretch from 52 to 62 feet and reconfigured 
                pit road with the installation of concrete pit stalls. Pushed the dog-leg curve between Turn 2 and Turn 3 out 95 feet and 
                tightened the turn radius of the dog-leg from 800 to 500 feet. Implemented banking, including 11-degree banking between 
                Turn 1 and Turn 2; 10-11-degree banking in the apex of the dog-leg; and 9-degree banking in Turns 3 and 4. Following the 
                2017 season, the track was renamed from Phoenix Raceway to ISM Raceway. ISM Raceway under went reconstruction following 
                the Spring race of 2018, with many new fan amenities added to the track, as well as the track itself being reconfigured so 
                that the start/finish line is now just before the dog leg. There have been 45 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races at ISM 
                Raceway, one per season from 1988-2004 and two each season since.
