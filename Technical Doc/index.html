                <h2>iPhone X</h2>
                <p> The iPhone X is a smartphone designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the eleventh
                    generation of the iPhone and was announced on
                    September 12, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone X was intended to showcase
                    what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using
                    a glass and stainless-steel form factor and "bezel-less" design, shrinking the bezels, and not
                    having
                    a "chin", unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home
                    button was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan
                    the user's face to unlock the device. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999
                    USD
                    also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to
                    additional local sales and import taxes.
                </p>
                <p>The iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were universally
                    praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due
                    to the sensor housing "notch" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new
                    authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app
                    developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience
                    in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others
                    acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence.
                    Face ID facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct
                    eyes on
                    the screen, though that option can be disabled within the system preferences. Along with the iPhone
                    6s, its Plus variant, and the iPhone SE, the iPhone X was discontinued on
                    September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the new iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone
                    XR devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest
                    ever
                    tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.

                <h2>Smart Refigerator</h2>
                <p>Smart refrigerator, also known as internet refrigerator, is a refrigerator which has been
                    programmed to sense what kinds of products are being stored inside it and keep a track of the stock
                    through barcode or RFID scanning. This kind of refrigerator is often equipped to determine itself
                    whenever a food item needs to be replenished.
                </p>
                <p>By the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the idea of connecting home appliances to the internet
                    (Internet of Things) had been popularized and was seen as the next big thing. In June 2000, LG
                    launched the worldâ€™s first internet refrigerator, the Internet Digital DIOS. This refrigerator was
                    an
                    unsuccessful product because the consumers had seen it as unnecessary and expensive (more
                    than $20,000).

                <h2>Smart Lock</h2>
                <p id="p" style="color: white;">A smart lock is an electromechanical lock which is designed to perform locking and unlocking
                    operations on a door when it receives such instructions from an authorized device using a wireless
                    protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. It also monitors access and
                    sends alerts for the different events it monitors and some other critical events related to the
                    status of
                    the device.
                    Smart locks can be considered part of a smart home. Most smart locks are installed on mechanical
                    locks (simple types of locks, including deadbolts) and
                    they physically upgrade the ordinary lock. Recently, smart locking controllers have also appeared at
                    the market.
                </p>
                <p id="p" style="color: white;">Smart locks, like the traditional locks, need two main parts to work: the lock and the key. In the
                    case
                    of these electronic locks, the key is not a physical key but a smartphone or a special key fob
                    configured explicitly for this purpose which wirelessly performs the authentication needed to
                    automatically unlock the door.
                    Smart locks allow users to grant access to a third party by means of a virtual key. This key can be
                    sent to the recipient smartphone over standard messaging protocols such as e-mail or SMS. Once
                    this key is received the recipient will be able to unlock the smart lock during the time previously
                    specified by the sender.

                <h2>Drones</h2>
                <p>Drones have become increasingly popular over the last few years, with many people and
                    organizations fully adopting fully and integrating this technology in their way of doing business.
                    Since Amazon made waves with the launch of its Amazon Air drone delivery service a few years
                    ago, the list of businesses using UAVs has been growing as we speak.
                    From delivering pizza to aiding search and rescue missions to defusing bombs, drones have
                    huge potential, sparing people from tedious, dangerous jobs that used to put millions of lives at
                    risk. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the companies that have pioneered the use of
                    this technology and how exactly they managed to do it effectively. Here are the top 5 companies
                    that are using drones.
                </p>
                <p>BBC News is one of those major media outlets that has always been open to implementing the
                    newest technologies in their journalism. In 2013, the hexacopters were first introduced by the
                    crafty BBC producers at BBC World
                    Service Language Servicesâ€™ Global Video Unit to capture unique footage of the U.K.-based HS2
                    railway project. Since then, the team has been constantly experimenting with ways to
                    seamlessly introduce drones into their journalism, piloting UAVs over war zones, natural
                    disasters, and dangerous situations that required a helicopter.
